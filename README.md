# OVERVIEW
Elasticsearch is an open source search and analysis engine built on Apache Lucene. It is widely used in scenarios such as full-text search, structured search, analysis, and retrieval of large amounts of data quickly and accurately. Although Elasticsearch provides a variety of RESTful APIs, the complexity of these APIs sometimes becomes a barrier for users. Therefore, we hope to have a more intuitive and easy-to-use method to operate Elasticsearch.

# Features
1. Use the Protobuf protocol to optimize data processing and significantly improve efficiency.
2. Integrate time-series database functions and introduce a more refined table partitioning strategy to efficiently process and aggregate data similar to subject attributes.
3. Implement a distributed cluster architecture to support a single business running across multiple clusters, effectively reducing the risk of single point failure.
